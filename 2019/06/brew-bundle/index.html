 <p>I recently discovered the <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle">brew bundle</a> tap. This
tap saves all your installed <a href="https://brew.sh">homebrew</a> packages to
a file. This makes it easy to version control your
installed packages or make a list easy list of packages
to share with others.</p>
<p>Install the Homebrew bundle tap, to activate the <code>brew bundle</code> command</p>
