  <h1> Hellofax Print Workaround</h1>
  <p><time> July 17, 2019</time><p>
 <p>I received a link to an official document that required my signature
via email last week. Unlike most people, I print out and read every
legsal document by line, highlighting the parts I do not understand and only
sign them after I&rsquo;ve understood everything in the  document.</p>
<p>The document was hosted on a web-service called Hellofax. Hellofax doesn&rsquo;t
provide a way to print out or export the document before signing, this workflow
doesn&rsquo;t work for people like me who carefully examine every legal document.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we have access to the browsers developer tools, so we can use a
specific css selector. Using the selector below, I was able to select all
the pages in the document.</p>
<pre><code>$('img[src*=&quot;hellofax_uploads/&quot;]')

</code></pre><p>I then used the following script to copy all the links to my clipboard</p>
<pre><code>items=$('img[src*=&quot;hellofax_uploads/&quot;]')
links = []
for(x=0; x&lt;items.length; x++) { console.info(links.push(items[x].src));}
copy(links)
</code></pre><p>I saved the clipboard item to a folder named <code>contract</code>, then used the following shell script to download all the images</p>
<pre><code>#download every image.
while read word; do URL=$word; wget $URL; done &lt; contract

# shorten names
ls conv* | awk '{ {printf &quot;%s &quot;,$1;} sub(/\?.*/, &quot;&quot;); { printf &quot; %s \n&quot;,$1; } }' &gt; tobemoved

# rename files
cat tobemoved | cut -d' ' -f3 | xargs -Ivar zsh -c &quot;mv var* var&quot;
</code></pre><p>These images can then be printed out and examined before signing.</p>
