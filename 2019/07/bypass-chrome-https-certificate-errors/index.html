 <p>Chrome often throws certificate errors for local development sites
with self-signed HTTPS certificates. As of this writing, the way
to get around this is to type <strong>thisisunsafe</strong> when the error appears.
The Chrome team sometimes updates this bypass, when that happens,
visit the Chrome <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/components/security_interstitials/core/browser/resources/interstitial_large.js#19">codebase</a> looking for the base64 encoded <strong>BYPASS_SEQUENCE</strong>.</p>
<p>Decode it using the following command, replacing BYPASS_SEQUENCE with the text
you copied from the code.</p>
